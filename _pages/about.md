Currently pursuing my Master’s in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, I serve as a researcher under Dr. Pydi Ganga Mamba Bahubalindruni in the Electronics Design and Integrated Circuit Testing **(EDICT)** Lab,Our research primarily focuses on the design of circuits for flexible electronics in healthcare, integrating interdisciplinary areas including circuit design, machine learning, and integrated circuit (IC).

My thesis topic is "Efficient implementation of Machine learning models on FPGA for accurate Arrhythmia Detection" which focuses on developing hardware-aware AI architectures designed to maximize computational efficiency and minimize resource overhead for both digital and analog circuit implementations.While working on this I have been exposed to multiple domains such as quantized machine learning models, Effcient circuit designing of ml architecture, Simulations and designing circuit level impleementation of ML models.
