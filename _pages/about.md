I’m an MS student at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal](https://www.iiserb.ac.in/), pursuing a dual degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I am currently a Graduate Researcher in the Electronic Design and IC Testing (EDICT) Lab under [Dr. Pydi Ganga M. Bahubalindruni](https://sites.google.com/site/bpgangaeecs/home), where my research lies at the intersection of hardware design, machine learning, and embedded systems, with a focus on deploying AI algorithms on resource-constrained and real-world hardware platforms.

My work has primarily focused on hardware-efficient AI and flexible electronics for healthcare applications. As part of my MS thesis, I am developing a low-power, low-complexity AI-on-chip architecture for arrhythmia classification from ECG signals, involving neural network quantization and FPGA-based implementation in Verilog. This has given me deep exposure to algorithm–hardware co-design, performance–resource trade-offs, and real-time embedded constraints.

Alongside my hardware-focused research, I have hands-on experience in robotics and multi-robot systems through projects in the Multi-Robot Autonomy (MOON) Lab and national-level robotics competitions. I worked on fuel-aware multi-robot coordination using CBBA with ROS on TurtleBots, and contributed to the development and control of an autonomous surface vehicle for the ISRO Robotics Challenge, involving simulation, control design, and deployment on real hardware. Across these projects, I have emphasized end-to-end system development, integrating perception, planning, control, and real-world validation.

Through these experiences, I have developed a strong interest in hardware-aware intelligent systems, embedded AI, and real-time control for autonomous platforms. Looking ahead, I aim to pursue a PhD to develop efficient, scalable, and hardware-conscious AI and control algorithms that can operate reliably in resource-constrained and real-world environments. I am particularly motivated to contribute to research that bridges foundational algorithmic development with practical hardware deployment.

When I’m not working, I enjoy photography, sketching, and playing basketball. These activities help me stay creative, active, and motivated — both inside and outside the lab.
