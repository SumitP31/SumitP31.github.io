Currently pursuing my Master’s in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Bhopal, I serve as a researcher under Dr. Pydi Ganga Mamba Bahubalindruni in the Electronics Design and Integrated Circuit Testing \textbf{(EDICT)} Lab,Our research primarily focuses on the design of circuits for flexible electronics in healthcare, integrating interdisciplinary areas including circuit design, machine learning, and integrated circuit (IC).

My thesis focuses on developing hardware-aware AI architectures designed to maximize computational efficiency and minimize resource overhead for both digital and analog circuit implementations. Specifically, I am designing hardware-accelerated architectures on FPGAs to enable real-time Arrhythmia detection through ECG signal analysis.
