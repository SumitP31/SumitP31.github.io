inventors: Your Name; Co-Inventor Name
assignee: Your Company / University
filing_date: 2026-01-30
application_no: TBD
status: Internal Disclosure
excerpt: >
  A hardware-agnostic self-supervised kinematic encoding system is disclosed that uses predictive joint embedding with Gaussian-based regularization to learn transferable gesture representations from unlabeled wearable sensor data.

technical_field: >
  The invention relates to wearable sensor systems, gesture recognition, and self-supervised machine learning.

background: >
  Existing wearable gesture recognition systems require large amounts of labeled data and do not generalize effectively across users and domains.

summary: >
  The disclosed system employs a joint embedding predictive architecture with isotropic Gaussian regularization to prevent representation collapse and enable efficient cross-domain transfer.

advantages:
  - Reduced labeled data requirements
  - Improved cross-domain generalization
  - Hardware-agnostic sensor compatibility
  - Stable self-supervised training without contrastive learning

keywords:
  - self-supervised learning
  - wearable sensors
  - gesture recognition
  - kinematic encoding

classification: G06F; G06K; A61B
