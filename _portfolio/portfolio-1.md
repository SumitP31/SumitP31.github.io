A Herarcial Stacked Decision Tree Model for Classifying Different Arrhythmias that can be efficiently implemented on low resource hardware platform such as low cost FPGA and Flexible IC. This work highly focuses on developing ML architecture that can accurately detecting Abnoramlity in ECG signal while minimizing the resources cost for computation.
