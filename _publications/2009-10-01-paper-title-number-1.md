excerpt: 'We introduce a JEPA-based self-supervised kinematic encoder trained with SIGReg that learns transferable gesture representations from unlabeled complex hand primitives. Our approach achieves 42.35% accuracy on ASL recognition using just 1% labeled data, outperforming a fully supervised baseline by 17.22%.'
